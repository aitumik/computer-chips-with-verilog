Creating computer chips with verilog and other hardware languages

## Logic Gates
> Logic gates have input and output
inputs and outputs can either be low or high(0 or 1)
In FPGA low is 0V while high can either be(1.8V,3.3V or 5V)

* The NOT Gate(The inverter)
The simplest logic gate. It has single input and single output
