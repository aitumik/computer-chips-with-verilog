Creating computer chips with verilog and other hardware languages

## Logic Gates
> Logic gates have input and output
inputs and outputs can either be low or high(0 or 1)
In FPGA low is 0V while high can either be(1.8V,3.3V or 5V)

* The NOT Gate(The inverter)
The simplest logic gate. It has single input and single output
It inverts the input: If the input is high then the output is low

* Others are (*AND* , *OR*, *NOR* & *NAND*)h
> NAND and NOR are inverted AND and OR respectively

## Binary Adder
Use XOR and AND gates
Logic gates allow you to use arithmetic numbers
Add an image here to show how single bit binary adder works here

## Important points
* (Flip-Flops)Sequential Logic : Feeding the output of a logic gate to the earlier logic
  gate and adding the logic to remember things
* Set-Reset(SR)Flip-Flop: If S and R are both low then the ouput if not
  predictable while if S is HIGH the output is always predictable 

* Binary Counters: <todo>
* Shift Registers: <todo>
